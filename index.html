    The AIM (AI for Immunological Molecules) Laboratory develops state-of-the-art tools for predicting immunogenicity by combining immunological data, deep learning, and molecular simulations. We are bioinformatians interested in everything about the immune system: cancer immunotherapy, vaccine development, antibody and TCR structure prediction and engineering. Our main focus is applying machine learning to immunology related problems, particularly combining novel algorithms with structural and immunological features. In connection, one of the strategic goals is constructing data driven models which will aid in modifying and steering the immune response towards an illness free outcome in cancer, autoimmunity or infectious disease. Currently the group is most invested in development of machine and deep learning tools that can be applied in B and T cell immunity.
