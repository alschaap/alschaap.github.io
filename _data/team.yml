  bio: >
   I am aa bioinformatician and computational biologist with an extensive expertise in the following areas:
   - Structural Bioinformatics
   - Machine Learning
   - Immunological Bioinformatics 
   - Immunotherapy

   I have a background in programming, robotics, control and systems theory, and a deep understanding of biology and immunology.
   I am  excited by anything that  combines 2 or more of the following things\: immunology, machine learning, protein structure prediction, obscure avantgard art, fancy cocktails. Probably not in this order.
