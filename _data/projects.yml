- name: Statistical Modelling of TCR Repertoires for Immunotherapy and Drug Delievery Systems
  description: >
    The aim of this project is disassembling mechanisms of immune system-tumour interaction, in particular to track and understand epitope spreading by means of high throughput sequencing and statistical modelling of T-cell receptor repertoires.
